        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a 4th-year undergraduate student attending the University of California - Riverside. I am pursuing a bachelor of science degree in Psychology as well as a minor in Public Policy.<br><br>

        I have volunteered and been a part of a Social/ Personality psychology research lab for about two years now and am interested in continuing my research. I also have experience in being a part of a Developmental Psychology research lab as well for about half a year. I look forward to gaining more research experience as I find research to be absolutely fascinating. I currently hold the title of Research Assistant, but I hope to soon become a Research Manager. I have garnered a lot of experience in learning about mindfulness and how it plays a role in our day-to-day life and how we as humans can further improve our mindfulness. I have also studied the state of flow in the psychological sense. Being in a state of flow means that you are so focused on something to the point where you lose track of what is happening around you. This usually happens with activities that are mildly tedious, but not too tedious where it is overwhelming. For example, people can get lost in flow when they are playing a video game or even when they are playing an instrument. The research I have conducted has mainly been focused on mindfulness and flow.<br><br>

        In addition to all of my research experience, I also have a background in other Psychology extracurriculars. I am currently a member of the psychology honor society on campus called Psi Chi. I have been a member for about 2 years now and I have enjoyed my time there so much. I currently also hold an executive board position for the organization. The name of the position is Co-Director of Events and Outreach. My job as Co-Director of Events and Outreach is to really promote our organization on social media as well as around campus. I am in charge of making social events for the general members of Psi Chi so that they can have some fun while learning more about Psychology. For example, in the past, I have made a social event where the general members at the University of California - Riverside were able to meet other students from other campuses and talk about each otherâ€™s experiences as psychology students and further their knowledge by giving each other advice and a stronger sense of a community. In addition to this I am also in charge of recruiting guest speakers for our general weekly meetings. This is the most important aspect of our organization because this is how our students are able to get the most help. This is because our guest speakers tend to be professional psychologists that vary in the different fields of psychology. In the past, I have recruited forensic psychologists, school psychologists, and clinical psychologists. Next year in Psi Chi, I will hopefully be running for the position of President and making my organization grow much bigger so more students can benefit from the resources available.
